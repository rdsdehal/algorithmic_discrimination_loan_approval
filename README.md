# Predictive Approach of Fairness in Loan Approval
Banks have increasingly adopted algorithmic models to make data-driven decisions, such as internal loan approvals. However, these models may introduce predictive analysis biases, potentially increasing credit risk exposure. This project will explore algorithmic discrimination in loan approval models using fairness metrics and predict future credit risk exposures arising from this bias, particularly focusing on personal attributes like age, employment status, or the number of dependents.

<h4>Problem Statement:</h4><br> To analyze algorithmic discrimination in loan approval models using fairness metrics and predict future credit risk exposures that may arise from identified biasness.

<h4>Problem Objectives:</h4></br>
&#10148;To download and preprocess existing loan approval dataset with different personal attributes like age, employment status or the number of household dependents.</br>
&#10148;To identify and select the most relevant dataset features that influence loan approval decisions.</br>
&#10148;To develop and train various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN Classification) to predict various loan approval biasness outcomes.</br>
&#10148;To evaluate the performance of the select models using approapriate metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 Score and ROC-AUC.</br>
&#10148;To optimize the selected model by fine-tuning hyperparameters to ensure model robustness and reliability.</br>
&#10148;To test the predictive model into the loan approval process, thus predict result with best performant model.

<h4>Research Questions: </h4></br>
&#10148;Are there inequalities or biasness in the loan approval process?</br>
&#10148;What variable may lead to a significant biased loan approval process?</br>
&#10148;What fairness interventions that may be deployed to identify the probable biasness in the loan approval process?</br>
&#10148;Which predictive analysis model will provide the best insights in addressing the loan approval process biasness?
